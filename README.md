# NeuroFlow Projects

Welcome to my collection of self-initiated projects exploring the intersection of **Neuroscience** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

This repository reflects my personal curiosity and growing passion for understanding how the human brain works and how that knowledge can inspire computational models, assistive technologies, and intelligent systems. Each project in this repo is the result of independent exploration, driven by the desire to bridge AI with brain science.

## Why This Repository?

As someone deeply interested in **cognitive science**, **brain-computer interfaces**, and **AI-powered neurotechnologies**, I wanted to step beyond academic theory and start experimenting.  
This repository is a sandbox where I:

- Process neural and physiological signals (like EEG, fMRI)
- Apply machine learning for classification and pattern discovery
- Explore brainwave-emotion relationships and eye state recognition
- Lay the groundwork for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) concepts

---

## Technologies & Tools

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- MNE, NiBabel for EEG/fMRI processing
- Git & GitHub for versioning and sharing
- Open datasets from BCI Competition, OpenNeuro

---

## Notes

- Large files like `.pkl` models and dataset folders have been excluded from this repo (see `.gitignore`)
- fMRI dataset `ds004301` is referenced but not stored here — it can be downloaded from [OpenNeuro Dataset]([https://openneuro.org/](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004301/versions/1.0.2/download))
- Virtual environments and compiled libraries are excluded from version control

---

## Highlights

- Successfully trained an EEG eye-state detection model
- Implemented signal cleaning and transformation pipelines
- Started exploratory analysis on fMRI for semantic mirroring
- Practiced working with biomedical formats and real-world neurodata

## About Me

I’m currently an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science with a strong drive to explore **neuro-inspired AI**. This project is entirely self-driven, and I’ve used it as a foundation to understand how AI can interface with and interpret biological signals. My long-term goal is to pursue advanced studies and research in neuroengineering, cognitive computing, or brain-machine interfaces, and contribute to assistive technologies that improve lives by advocating reduced dependency on technology and greater cognitive autonomy, while unraveling the hidden marvels of the human brain.
