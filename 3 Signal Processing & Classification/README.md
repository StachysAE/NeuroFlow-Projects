# Signal Processing & Classification

This project focuses on processing EEG signals and applying machine learning techniques to classify mental states or cognitive activity. It serves as a foundational step in building data-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

---

## Purpose

- Learn preprocessing techniques for raw EEG data  
- Extract meaningful features from time-series signals  
- Apply and evaluate machine learning models for classification tasks

---

## Features

- Signal cleaning: filtering, normalization, and artifact handling  
- Feature extraction: statistical, spectral, and time-domain features  
- Model training: includes SVM, Random Forest, and basic neural networks  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- SciPy, Scikit-learn  
- MNE (optional for EEG-specific preprocessing)

---

## Note

- This project uses open EEG datasets or simulated inputs.
- Large model files and raw datasets are excluded from the repo (see .gitignore).
- This is an experimental learning module, not intended for clinical use.
