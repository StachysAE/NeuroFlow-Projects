# Simulated EEG Signal Visualizer

This project is a simple visualization tool to simulate and display EEG signals using synthetic waveforms. It serves as a foundation for understanding EEG signal structure, waveform composition, and temporal behavior — especially useful before diving into real EEG data.

---

## Purpose

- To visualize EEG-like signals for conceptual clarity
- To simulate basic brainwave components (alpha, beta, theta, etc.)
- To build a foundation for EEG preprocessing and analysis

---

## Features

- Generates synthetic EEG signals using sine wave combinations
- Visualizes time-series plots using Matplotlib
- Adjustable parameters for frequency, amplitude, and duration

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   python signal_generator.py

## Note
This is a conceptual demo using synthetic signals — not medical or neuroscientific data.
