# MindWave or Muse Signal Reader

A beginner-friendly tool to generate and visualize synthetic EEG signals for educational and prototyping purposes. It helps build an intuitive understanding of brainwave behavior before working with real neural data.

---

## Purpose

- Explore how different brainwave patterns can be simulated
- Understand the structure and frequency ranges of EEG signals
- Create a safe environment to test signal plotting and preprocessing logic

---

## Features

- Generates synthetic EEG data with multiple frequency bands
- Visualizes continuous waveforms in real-time or from generated data
- Customizable waveform parameters to simulate different mental states

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy (signal generation)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to this folder  
3. Run the notebook or script:

   ```bash
   python signal_generator.py
